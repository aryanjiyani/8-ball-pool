# 8-ball-pool
I've developed 8-ball pool game using python and its library.

If you want to run it in your device than simply download this file and run it on any python plateform ..

And if you are not able to identify "pygame" module than you need to run following command first,

### 'pip install pygame' 

After that you can run the program and enjoy the game.
